Hey guys, this is a project that i learned to develop through a youtube video published by the <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA"Traversy media channel></a> where it teaches how to create a clone of the netflix homepage.
The purpose of this project is for me to train my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS and some puglins with JQUERY.
